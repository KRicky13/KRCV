# KR_CV
My online CV, written using HTML5+CSS3 without the use of frameworks to familiarise myself with the nitty-gritty bits of the language.

Important files are:
* cv.html (main CV page)
  - bio.html
  - qualifications_skills.html
- CV_CSS.css
- QUALIF_SKILLS_CSS.css
- DOCX and PDF downloadable files of my resume and transcript (should really look into permission settings for these files)

*** cvV1_0.html, cvV1_1.html and cvV2_0.html pre-dates my GitHub/version control days and serves as a development timeline of sorts, and also as a reminder of what NOT to do for software dev work
